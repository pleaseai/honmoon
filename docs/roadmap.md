# Honmoon Roadmap

> Status: Draft (v0.1) · Last updated: 2026-06-20
>
> A phased path from the current scaffold to a production-grade, open-core firewall
> gateway. Phases are roughly sequential but later OSS phases can overlap. The
> **OSS / Paid** column marks the open-core boundary (see [`business-model.md`](./business-model.md)).

## Where we are

Greenfield monorepo, scaffolded and building:

- Cargo workspace (`honmoon-core`, `honmoon-proxy`, `honmoon-cli`) — builds, 4 tests pass.
- Bun workspace (`@honmoon/policy`, `@honmoon/cli`, `@honmoon/api`) + React/Vite/Tailwind dashboard.
- Policy model (YAML + JSON Schema), example policy, `evaluate()` with domain matching.
- `honmoon run/gateway/join` are CLI stubs (`bail!`).
- Decided: Pingora for the HTTP data plane ([ADR-0001](../.please/docs/decisions/0001-adopt-pingora-http-data-plane.md)).

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations ✅ (done)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Monorepo scaffold (Cargo + Bun + dashboard) | ✅ |
| Policy model + JSON Schema + example policy | ✅ |
| Knowledge docs, ARCHITECTURE.md, business model | ✅ |
| ADR-0001 (Pingora) | ✅ |

---

## Phase 1 — HTTP egress MVP `OSS` ✅ (done)

The first vertical slice: `honmoon run` actually enforces a domain allowlist.

- [x] Terminating `CONNECT` forward proxy in `honmoon-proxy::gateway` (raw tokio — see [ADR-0002](../.please/docs/decisions/0002-phase1-connect-proxy-on-tokio.md))
- [x] Read CONNECT host → `Facts{domain}` → `evaluate()` → allow tunnels / deny `403` / non-CONNECT `405`
- [x] `honmoon run --policy p.yaml -- <cmd>`: ephemeral proxy, set `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` for the child, exec, propagate exit code
- [x] `honmoon gateway --config p.yaml --addr ...` runs the proxy standalone
- [x] Hermetic integration test: allowed host tunnels to a local upstream, denied host blocked with 403
- [ ] (deferred to Phase 2) TLS termination — needed only for body/HTTP-level rules; Pingora revisited there

**Exit criteria**: ✅ proven by `crates/honmoon-proxy/tests/egress.rs` — an allowed host tunnels
through to an in-process upstream (`200`), a denied host is blocked (`403`), hermetically over loopback.
(The literal `curl https://github.com` smoke works too but is network-dependent; the automated test is hermetic.)

---

## Phase 2 — Policy engine: CEL + facts `OSS` ✅ (done)

- [x] Integrate `cel-interpreter` in `honmoon-core`
- [x] `decide()`: rules in order — match `endpoint`, evaluate `condition` over `Facts`, return `verdict`; else egress lists
- [x] HTTP facts (`http.method`, `http.path`, `http.host`, `http.body_size`) exposed to CEL as `http`
- [x] Rule ordering / precedence documented (first matching rule wins; deny>allow>default for egress)
- [x] Consolidated the policy engine in `honmoon-core` (domain matching moved out of `honmoon-proxy`)
- [ ] (carried) Keep Rust `honmoon-core` and TS `@honmoon/policy` in sync — TD-001

**Exit criteria**: ✅ CEL rules evaluate correctly against synthetic facts — see `crates/honmoon-core/src/engine.rs` tests (`cel_rule_matches_http_fact`, `rule_endpoint_must_match`, `unknown_fact_reference_does_not_match`).
Note: real `http.method`/`path`/`body_size` need TLS termination (later phase); over CONNECT only `http.host` is populated.

---

## Phase 3 — Protocol awareness (SQL / K8s) `OSS` ✅ (done)

The moat: wire-level protocol parsing beyond HTTP — in `honmoon-core::protocols`.

- [x] PostgreSQL simple-query (`'Q'`) wire parser → `sql.verb`, `sql.table` (`parse_postgres_query`)
- [x] SQL verb/table heuristic over a statement (`parse_sql`) — DROP/TRUNCATE/DELETE/UPDATE/INSERT/SELECT
- [x] Kubernetes API facts → `k8s.resource`, `k8s.verb`, `k8s.namespace` (`parse_k8s_request`; core + grouped APIs, list vs get)
- [x] `sql`/`k8s` facts wired into the CEL engine; per-endpoint policy binding via `Rule::endpoint`
- [ ] (carried) Live inline TCP relay that feeds the parsers from real traffic — needs endpoint listener config + (for K8s) TLS termination; see TD-006

**Exit criteria**: ✅ a `DROP`/`TRUNCATE` against `postgres-prod` and a `delete secrets` against
`k8s-prod` are caught by policy — proven end-to-end (raw packet/request → parser → `decide()`) by
`engine.rs::protocol_facts_drive_policy_end_to_end` and against the shipped `policies/agent.yaml` by
`shipped_example_policy_fires`.
Note: parsing is engine-complete and tested; wiring it onto a live socket is the data-plane follow-up (TD-006).

---

## Phase 4 — Verdicts, audit & dashboard `OSS`

- [ ] `pause` verdict: hold a request pending approval (local, single-node)
- [ ] Local audit log (every verdict, structured) + query API in `@honmoon/api`
- [ ] Dashboard: audit log viewer, policy editor (Prism), approval queue
- [ ] Embed built dashboard into the Rust binary via `rust-embed`; served by the management API

**Exit criteria**: a `pause` rule surfaces in the dashboard and can be approved/denied; the
decision is recorded in the audit log.

---

## Phase 5 — Isolation modes `OSS`

- [ ] `honmoon gateway` — standalone central proxy loading policy, accepting clients
- [ ] `honmoon run` hardened isolation (Linux netns / macOS NetworkExtension)
- [ ] `honmoon join` — route host traffic to a gateway via tunnel (WireGuard)
- [ ] Policy hot-reload via Pingora graceful reload

**Exit criteria**: all three modes work end-to-end on Linux; documented setup.

---

## Phase 6 — Team / control plane `Paid`

The open-core boundary. Monetization begins where single-node becomes fleet.

- [ ] Centralized policy management across multiple nodes/agents
- [ ] RBAC / SSO / SAML
- [ ] Approval routing + Slack notifications
- [ ] Long-term audit retention & search; compliance/exfil reports
- [ ] `packages/enterprise/` under a commercial license (BSL/FSL)

---

## Phase 7 — Hosted SaaS & intelligence `Paid`

- [ ] Hosted management plane (`apps/cloud/`), multi-tenant
- [ ] Managed allowlists + threat-intel feeds
- [ ] API-credential isolation sidecar (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini) with rate limiting
- [ ] SLA / support tiers

---

## Cross-cutting (ongoing)

- **Licensing**: move core to Apache-2.0; add `LICENSE.enterprise` (BSL/FSL) when Phase 6 lands.
- **Tech debt**: TD-001 (dual policy model → generate from JSON Schema), TD-002 (`serde_yaml`).
- **CI/CD**: set up `cargo test`/`clippy`/`fmt` + `bun test`/`lint` gates once a remote exists.
- **Optional Squid backend**: `deploy/squid/` as an alternate HTTP egress backend.
- **Cloudflare target**: a Workers deployment can host the egress filter + control plane only;
  the wire-level core requires a host/container.

---

## Platform reality check

Not every layer runs everywhere — record this so scope stays honest:

| Capability | Self-host (host/container) | Cloudflare Workers |
|------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| HTTP egress filter + control plane | ✅ | ✅ (explicit proxy only) |
| Wire-level SQL/K8s, `run`/`join`, TLS MITM | ✅ | ❌ (needs OS networking) |
